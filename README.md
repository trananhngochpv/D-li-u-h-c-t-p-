Dear: Hackathon Organizing Committee!
        Dear: Hackathon investors!
 Personally, I would like to submit my entry with the content "PLAN FOR DETECTING CANCER IN THE EARLIEST STAGE".


Main content :
1) Identify cells with "GEN mutations leading to transformation into cancer cells"
2) Are cytokine toxins the cause of GEN mutations?
3) In this issue, we need to know the presence of all immune system cells, antibodies, and antigens participating in the process of attacking mutant cells to the stage of becoming cancer cells.
? Free radicals
? T lymphocytes are cytotoxic
? NK natural autoimmune cells
? Synapse nerve cells carry electricity - chemistry... Etc
- pay attention to the cell presentation process of the immune system, is this problem related to memory T lymphocytes?
In addition to the process of cytotoxicity by chemical toxins such as in (macrophagocytes) or immune system cells, is there any hypothesized possibility that the neural synapse has the ability to release its own voltage? that cell through a method that assumes that the energetic interaction of cell molecules carries the induced magnetic field energy thanks to the structure of the (cell membrane - biofilm) which is the shell that separates the surface cell nuclei with genetically mutated cells transform into cancer cells...

NOTABLE CONTENTS:
 The main issue to be retrieved in the above data is the process of the GEN mutated cell in transition
The processes that transform into cancer cells will be monitored:
The cause of mutation is the ability to cause cytotoxicity, causing the absorbing environment of genetically mutated cells to not be able to replicate or lose the ability to reproduce during cell division.

It is assumed that the regeneration spindle of GEN mutated cells is suppressed because the negative and positive potentials separated by the cell membrane are destroyed by cytotoxic methods leading to mutant cells. Genetic mutants with autoimmune ability can no longer reproduce but absorb nutrients to form a biofilm called a lipid bilayer. ( Need to find)
This biofilm is a protective membrane that helps GEN mutant cells transform into cancer cells and will no longer be attacked by the release of Cytokine toxins, but only nervous system immune cells will have electricity. The polar opposite of them has the ability to attack by releasing inherent energy in the form of electromagnetic induction to attack the inner nucleus of the mutant cell through the hard and shiny membrane like in the BACTERIA strain. We take the GOLDEN BRIDGE as an example in the disease of small cell LUNG CANCER

So can we reason and analyze the metabolism corresponding to the color change of a virus sample called staphylococcus?
This line belongs
 Order: Bacillales
- The nomenclature is: Staphylococcus aureus
-Species: S.aureus
 The aureus has three color stages: The first stage is white, the second stage is purple and the next stage is yellow. Aureus has a yellow color that is said to be found in patients with lung cancer and Their hard yellow shell makes them very awkward and difficult to attack, and their lifespan also increases.
Detection and diagnostic methods such as gram staining and electron microscopy have a low rate of detecting tumors and cancer and doctors cannot intervene early to treat patients.

All of the above data has raised issues related to the research content: Medical equipment to detect Cancer and Tumors in patients at the earliest stages.
My wish is to build a database to contribute and support related organizations and also be an entry for a devpost Hackathon with a grand prize for me to buy a house. welcomed my parents from far away to live with me.
                       ****************
Map the device's functional logic based on the database and personal judgment
•™ SPECIALIZED FORMATION AND METABOLISM PROCESSES OF SOME CELLS NEED VERY RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS IN THE PROJECT.
#Embryo Cells SPECIALIZED INTO ANTIBODY CELLS IN DAMAGED ORGANS!
* In case the fetus is formed by the time eligible for an ultrasound, the results detect two fetal hearts, but some time later when the ultrasound is scheduled again, the results show that there is only one fetal heart....... ..???!
In this case, the formation of two fetal hearts fails. Embryonic cells are specifically responsible for transforming into damaged heart parts, the placenta is only responsible for transmitting nutrients to nourish the embryonic cells to form body parts in the fetus.
With the ability to transform into any body part, the origin is definitely embryonic cells. However, when one fetal heart is destroyed, only one main fetal heart remains to complete the body of the fetus. This is a sign for us to recognize the formation of the first ANTIBODY CELL of the immune system in the process. formation of immune system cells.
In the next case... Symptoms of the fetus after birth were found to have otitis media. This is a fairly common case in which newborns are discovered.
However, what you should know and learn about this issue is that the specialized cells that transform into body parts of the brain have shown signs of damage since the time in the mother's womb.
This damage is quite reasonable in the midbrain.

Midbrain
[https://vi.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trung_n%C3%A3o ]
This problem shows that when specialized cells transform into damaged parts of the brain, this is most likely the origin of the natural autoimmune nerve cells NK.
And moreover, it is possible that this problem also proves the formation of lymphocytes.
   •™Important for the formation of one of the most elite cells of some pluripotent stem cell research.
If we clearly know the formation and characteristics of antibody cells of the body's immune system in the brain area that participate in the event of attacking cells with the ability to mutate GENE to transform into cells. cancer after the process of "antigen presentation" and "inflammatory response".
Measuring indexes of nerve cells, such as in the nerve body, give a resting voltage value of -65mV or cells that also belong to the brain, such as the nerve synapse, carry electrons present in an area such as a damaged area in the lungs. , in the Liver or Pancreas, we understand that this is most likely nerve antibody cells moving down to the place where the SOS signal is sent during the process of inflammatory response or antigen presentation, which can be a sign of preparation. There is an attack on cells with the opposite energy, negative energy, a special sign of involvement of at least two cells of the brain in the immune system.
Is the cell always present? Is the electron-carrying nerve synapse responsible for connecting and transmitting nerve signals the first thing to recognize when we discover the possibility of a cell's gene mutation at a certain location? Is it possible to form cancer or tumors?
This is not convincing
      So let's analyze one more example. This is a personal analysis of lung cancer.
    The content of the problem that needs to be analyzed to get evidence in this section is to learn about the "bacteria" - "virus" named: Staphylococcus
Retrieve data from Wikipedia's open encyclopedia data
[https://vi.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%E1%BB%A5_c%E1%BA%A7u_khu%E1%BA%A9n ]
Here we learn about the Staphylococcus aureus strain, which is personally assessed as:
•™ Because they belong to the order: Bacillales, a strain of Gram-positive bacteria, classified in the phylum Firmicutes. Representative genera include Bacillus
*) This is very important when we know their association with the "bacillus" called Bacillus subtilis - a strain of beneficial bacteria that is quite special to our body and often appears in the small digestive tract. People. They are chosen as model organisms in many studies on genetic engineering or genetic engineering.
As a "good bacteria" of the human body in the process of supporting the stomach in digestive fermentation, their first advantage is that they are not attacked by immune cells in a large area with organ tissue cells. Tumors and inflammation appear in the body, bacteria attack after an inflammatory response or cell presentation.
•™ Assuming this strain has the ability to reproduce and divide, perhaps reading and learning to copy the DNA structure of human body cells - the process of recombining DNA from which it is formed specifically in a species of bacillus - beneficial bacteria.
    HYPOTHESIS BETWEEN B.SUPTILIS AND S.AUREUS WHEN ENCOUNTERING LYMPHO T ANTIBODIES REMEMBER
 If there is a situation where a MEMORY LYMPHO T antibody cell with a regenerating branch axis participates in attacking the S.aureus strain, especially when this strain is parasitic on the beneficial bacteria B.suptilis.
 Suppose our body's brain antibody cells use negative electrical potential (resting potential) (for example -65 mV) and neurotransmitters to contact the staphylococcus aureus bacteria that are living in association. produced with B.Suptils for the purpose of communicating cell signals to complete differentiation and cell presentation.
It is the phenomenon of releasing negative voltage (signaling between cells) of antibody cells in the brain that creates the process called inflammatory response. A special SOS alarm method found only in memory cells to notify a collection of antibody cells responsible for destroying mutated cells or bacteria that are confirmed to be the cause of the tumor. - cancer.

SO IF YOU ASSUMPT ABOUT THE PROCESS"
CELL SIGNAL COMMUNICATION" AS INDIVIDUAL'S ASSUMPTION AS ABOVE IS CONSIDERED AND RESEARCHED - PROVED WHEN SUPPORTED BY TECHNIQUES: BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE (BCI) OF BRAIN GATE CHIP OR NEURALINK CHIP IS CAPABLE THE ABILITY TO READ BRAIN NEURAL CELL SIGNALS. SUCCESSES IN MEDICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH ARE VERY SUPPORTING US HUMANS IN THE PROBLEM OF SUPPORTING HUMANS.
THIS COMBINATION IS MAGICAL AS A REASONABLE DATABASE AND USEFUL FOR DETECTING CANCER AT THE EARLIEST STAGE.
